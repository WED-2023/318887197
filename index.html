  <h2>Q&A</h2>
  <div class="answers">
    <p><strong>1. Three Main Differences Between Web1, Web2, and Web3:</strong></p>
    <p>The first major difference between Web1, Web2, and Web3 is content creation. Web1 was primarily a read-only web, where users could only consume static information provided by website owners.<br> In Web2, the internet became interactive, allowing users to create and share content through social media, blogs, and forums.<br> Web3 takes this further by enabling users not only to read and write but also to own their data and digital assets through decentralized platforms.<br></p>
    <p>The second key difference is data control. In Web1, data was stored on centralized servers owned by companies or institutions.<br> Web2 introduced large platforms like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, which centralized control over vast amounts of user data.<br> In contrast, Web3 is decentralized, with information stored on blockchain networks, giving users greater privacy and ownership over their data.<br></p>
    <p>The third difference is monetization and security. Web1 had minimal monetization options, as websites were mostly informational.<br> Web2 introduced advertising-based revenue models, where large tech companies profited from user data and targeted ads.<br> Web3 shifts towards decentralized finance (DeFi), using blockchain and smart contracts to enable direct peer-to-peer transactions and token-based economies without intermediaries.<br></p>

    <p><strong>2. Example Use Case: Searching for "Side Effects of Medications":</strong></p>
    <p>If a user searches for "side effects of medications" in Web1, they would find a basic, static webpage containing predefined information about drug side effects.<br> The content would be written by a website owner, and there would be no way for users to ask questions, interact, or receive updated information.<br></p>
    <p>In Web2, the same search would yield results from Google, showing not only official medical websites but also user-generated content on platforms like Reddit, Quora, and YouTube.<br> Users could read personal experiences, watch videos, and participate in discussions.<br> However, the search results would be influenced by algorithms and advertisements, and the data would be collected and used by large tech companies.<br></p>
    <p>In Web3, the search would be conducted on a decentralized search engine, where results come from blockchain-based medical databases.<br> The information would be verified by smart contracts, ensuring accuracy and transparency.<br> Instead of relying on a single entity, a decentralized network of users and experts could contribute and validate data.<br> Additionally, users might be rewarded with cryptocurrency for sharing reliable medical insights, and their data would remain private and secure.<br></p>
    <p>This evolution demonstrates how the web has transitioned from static, read-only pages to a more interactive and user-controlled digital experience.<br></p>
